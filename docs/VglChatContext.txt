VGL, which stands for Voodoo Gitless, is a version control system based on the principles espoused
in Gitless. Its name honors the Voodoo Voltage FRC 4087 robotics team and Gitless, which provided
inspiration for the VGL project.

As with Gitless VGL provides a wrapper around Git to effect a simplified user model that is easy
and concistent enough for novices to learn while still being effective for experts. VGL must be
tolerant of changes to an underlying Git repository made outside of VGL.

AI based iterative development should use UseCases.md and HelpCommand.java as the source of truth
for all development, testing and refactoring. As needed, Gitless documentation and implementation
should be used for general guidance.
