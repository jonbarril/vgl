Voodoo Gitless (TEST_VERSION) -- Git for mortals

Concepts and Workflows

Understanding vgl:

  Workspace
    Files under the repo root (determined by your CWD).
    Changes live in the workspace until you 'commit' them.

  Undecided files
    • Files not yet explicitly tracked, untracked, or ignored.
    • Applies to new and existing files.
    • Once decided, cannot revert to undecided.

  Local repo
    The Git repo on your machine, inferred from CWD.

  Context (switch state)
    1) Current local branch
    2) Current remote URL (optional)
    3) Current remote branch
    Use 'status' to observe context. Use 'switch' to show or set context.

  Command guarantees
    1) status: observe only; never changes workspace files
    2) switch: sets context; -lb switches files; -rr/-rb never switch files
    3) commit: saves workspace changes to local history only
    4) checkout: creates a working copy of a remote repo
    5) pull: reviews remote changes before applying; never auto-commits
    6) push/checkin: send local commits to a remote
    7) split/merge: local history operations only

Typical workflows:

  Working locally:
    1) Track files you want under version control.
    2) Commit to create history.
    3) Use split/merge to experiment on branches.

  Collaborating with a remote:
    1) Use checkout to materialize a remote repo.
    2) Use switch -rr/-rb to set remote context.
    3) Pull to merge remote changes, then commit, then push.

Examples for non-obvious commands:

  switch -> changes context, may change workspace
    vgl switch -lb feature          # Switch branch (switches files)
    vgl switch -rr https://... -rb dev  # Set remote (no file switch)
    vgl switch -bb staging          # Set local+remote branch

  checkout -> materializes remote repo
    vgl checkout -rr https://github.com/user/repo  # Clone
    vgl checkout -rr https://... -rb dev  # Clone branch

  split -> branch + switch
    vgl split -into -lb experiment  # Create from current
    vgl split -from -lb main        # Create from 'main'

  merge -> combine + switch
    vgl merge -from -lb feature  # Merge into current
    vgl merge -into -lb main     # Merge into 'main'
