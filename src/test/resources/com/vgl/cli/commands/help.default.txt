Voodoo Gitless (TEST_VERSION) -- Git for mortals

vgl hides Git's complexity so you can focus on your work.


Key concepts:

  - A repo is a folder tree tracked by vgl.
  - Your workspace is the files in that folder tree.
  - A local repo lives on your computer.
  - A remote repo lives elsewhere and is optional.
  - Changes persist only when you commit.
  - Collaboration is explicit.


Common commands:

Workspace and context:
  create      Create a repo or branch
  switch      Change branch or remote context
  status      Show workspace and sync state

Local work:
  track       Add files to version control
  commit      Save workspace changes to history
  split       Branch and start independent work
  merge       Combine local branches

Remote collaboration:
  checkout    Get a remote repo to work on
  pull        Review and merge remote changes
  push        Send local commits to a remote
  checkin     Share work for remote review
  sync        Pull then push

Review and recovery:
  diff        Compare changes
  log         Show commit history
  restore     Undo workspace changes
