Voodoo Gitless (TEST_VERSION) -- Git for mortals

Vgl is Git for mortals. It hides Git's complexity and lets you focus on your work.

Key concepts:
  - Your workspace holds files under the repo root (from CWD)
  - Commit creates history - changes persist only when you commit
  - Collaboration is explicit - use push/pull to share work

Common commands:
  Context:
    create      Create new repo or branch
    switch      Change branch or remote
    status      Report workspace and sync state

  Local work:
    track       Add files to version control
    commit      Save changes to history
    split       Experiment on a new branch
    merge       Combine branches

  Remote collaboration:
    checkout    Get a remote repo
    pull        Merge remote changes
    push        Share local commits
    sync        Pull then push

  Review:
    diff        Compare versions
    log         Show commit history
    restore     Undo workspace changes
