Voodoo Gitless (TEST_VERSION) -- Git for mortals

diff -- Compare files between any two sources

Usage:
  vgl diff [-v|-vv] [GLOB...]
  vgl diff [-v|-vv] COMMIT [GLOB...]
  vgl diff [-v|-vv] COMMIT1 COMMIT2 [GLOB...]
  vgl diff [-v|-vv] [GLOB...] [-lr DIR]... [-lb BRANCH]... [-rr URL]... [-rb BRANCH]...

How sources work:
  - 0 sources: A = workspace; B = local branch (switch state)
  - 1 source:  A = workspace; B = the specified source
  - 2 sources: A and B are as specified

Sources:
  - The workspace is always a valid source.
  - COMMIT is a commit identifier.
  - Local sources use -lr and/or -lb (default repo/branch come from CWD/switch state).
  - Remote sources use -rr and/or -rb (default URL/branch come from switch state).

Examples:
  vgl diff                            Workspace vs HEAD
  vgl diff COMMIT                      Workspace vs commit
  vgl diff -lb main -lb feature       Local branch comparison
  vgl diff -rb dev                    Workspace vs remote 'dev' (remote URL from switch state)
  vgl diff -rr URL1 -rb main -rr URL2 -rb main  Remote-to-remote

Notes:
  - diff never changes files; it only reports differences
