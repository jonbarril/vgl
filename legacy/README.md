# Legacy Reference Snapshot

This folder contains a *reference-only* copy of the historical VGL implementation.

- Source: https://github.com/jonbarril/vgl
- Snapshot branch: `refactor20251208`
- Purpose: quick lookup during refactors (patterns, utilities, wiring), not used by the build.

Notes:
- The snapshot is stored as plain files (no nested `.git`) to avoid confusion with repo tooling.
